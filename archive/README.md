# Archive (Legacy)

This folder contains legacy scripts and notes that are not part of the current Web UI workflow.

## Contents

- `run_interactive.py`: interactive/manual-upload demo runner
- `run_openclaw.py`: one-off demo script
- `WORKFLOW.md`: legacy workflow notes for the above scripts

## Recommended Path

Use the Web UI instead:

1. Start backend: `python3 -m autosedance.main server --reload`
2. Start frontend: `cd apps/web && npm run dev`

Please write a complete storyboard-style script with rich visuals.
Remember:
1. Each segment must include concrete shot descriptions.
2. Each segment must end with a clear last-frame anchor for continuity.
3. Keep descriptions specific and actionable for later video generation.
4. Include a consistent music direction (global + per-segment cues) and keep the music continuous across segments (same motif/tempo/instrumentation; only intensity/layering may evolve).

## Important
1. If this is the first segment, create a strong opening frame based on the script.
2. If continuity summaries are present, you must continue the last ending frame and character states.
3. Keep the prompt concrete, visual, and camera-aware; avoid abstract wording.
4. Make the ending frame explicit so the next segment can continue seamlessly.

Please generate the JSON for this segment.
